*Description*
Working with an agency who manage the sites for a number of large customers in SA. They are scaling one of their customers and need to go through a security and compliance evaluation for their security team. This is high priority given they've experienced outages in the past. Next call is to review their security requirements in full, assisting them with the right documentation and then a recommendation for Vercel Enterprise.
